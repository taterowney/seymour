# Contributing to [Seymour]

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [Seymour]!
We welcome all contributions from the community and appreciate your efforts to improve the project.

## Code style

If you contribute to the project, do not worry about code style too much;
none of the style rules is enforced by a linter;
we will accept your PR regardless of style;
Martin will eventually adjust it.
The guideline below is written primarily to assist you in reading the code.

### Global variables

- Implicit and typeclass arguments may be put after `variable` but explicit arguments may not be. Example and a non-example:

  `variable {R : Type} [R : Ring] (a : R)`

  While `{R : Type} [R : Ring]` in encouraged, the explicit argument `(a : R)` is not allowed to be a global variable.
  As a result, when you call a function or a lemma, you can be sure that all required arguments are visible at the lines of given function or lemma,
  which is very important.
- We use global variables sparingly — usually for arguments that are used by the entire file or section.

### Lines

- Lines should not be longer than 128 characters (see the vertical ruler in VS Code) unless the line contains a long URL.
- Starting a proof on a new line is recommended even in cases where the entire proof fits into the same line with the statement.
- Make 2 empty lines between imports and the content of the file.
- Make 1 empty line between the start of a section and a declaration.
- Make 1 empty line between declarations of any kind.
- Make 1 empty line between a declaration and the end of a section.
- Make 2 empty lines between the end of a section and what follows.
- Each file ends with a linebreak.

### Indentation

- We use the same indentation as Mathlib.
  - Subitem: 2 spaces
  - Continuation of the same item after a linebreak: 4 spaces
- Deviations from the style are welcome if they hint some metaïnformation.

### Spaces

- There is always a space before a bracket (of any kind) opens and after it closes. Example:

  `foo {R : Type} [R : Ring] (a b : R) : ⟨a, b⟩ ∈ S`
- Space after a brace opens and before a brace closes is written only in the `Set` builder and in `Subtype` declarations. Examples:

  `{ x : X | ∃ y : Y, Bar x y }`

  `{ x₁ : α × β₁ // f x₁.fst = Sum.inl x₁.snd }`

- With a comma, a space is written only after it, not before.
- With a colon, a space is written from both sides.

### Naming

#### Constants

- Use `camelCase` and `PascalCase` and `snake_case` the same way Mathlib uses them.
  - Constants that live in `Sort` (i.e., new `Type` and `Prop` declarations) are written in `PascalCase`
  - All other constants that live in `Type` (e.g. functions that return real numbers) are written in `camelCase`
  - Constants that live in `Prop` (i.e., theorems and lemmas) are written in `snake_case` whose constituents are other constants converted to `camelCase` and other standard tokens like `ext` or `cancel`
- We like to write `.` in the name of a constant if it facilitates the use of dot notation when calling it. Usually it means that the part of the name that comes before the last `.` is identical to the type of the first explicit argument.
  - In such a case, the parts before the last `.` are not converted to `camelCase`

#### Variables

- Data variables (both in arguments and local variables) are always denoted by a single letter, possibly with other stuff after it like lower index or apostrophe.
- Prop variables (both in arguments and local variables) are always denoted by multiple letters, possibly with other stuff after them like lower index or apostrophe.
  - Prefix `h` means "the statement is anything about the following variables"
  - Not starting with `h` means that the actual statement (or its substantial part) is spelled out, not only the variables that appear in it
- Examples:

  `intro a b a_lt_b hab`
  - `a` carries data (e.g. an integer)
  - `b` carries data (e.g. an integer)
  - `a_lt_b` carries a proof of `a < b`
  - `hab` carries any information about `a` and `b`

  `intro x y x_eq_y h1 h1'`
  - `x` carries data (e.g. an integer)
  - `y` carries data (e.g. an integer)
  - `x_eq_y` carries a proof of `x = y`
  - `h1` carries any information involving the number `1`
  - `h1'` carries another information involving the number `1`

  `intro M hM hM'`
  - `M` carries data (e.g. a matroid)
  - `hM` carries any information about `M`
  - `hM'` carries another information about `M`

  `intro M M' hM hM'`
  - `M` carries data (e.g. a matroid)
  - `M'` carries data (e.g. a matroid)
  - `hM` carries any information about `M`
  - `hM'` carries any information about `M'`

  `intro M₁ M₂ hM₁ hM₂ hMM`
  - `M₁` carries data (e.g. a matroid)
  - `M₂` carries data (e.g. a matroid)
  - `hM₁` carries any information about `M₁`
  - `hM₂` carries any information about `M₂`
  - `hMM` carries any information about both `M₁` and `M₂` (indices after `hMM` are not needed)
- Never name anything `this` or standalone `h` (these names are acceptable neither for data nor for propositions), but leaving automatically named stuff with `this` or `h` is encouraged if the term is not explicitly referred to later.
  - Writing names like `h₁` or `h'` or `this'` or `this_` is strongly discouraged regardless of the purpose
- Real-life example (focus on the third line of each version – explicit arguments of the lemma):
  - Unacceptable argument names:
    ```lean
    lemma Multiset.sum_lt_sum {ι α : Type*} [OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid α]
        {s : Multiset ι} {f g : ι → α}
        (h : ∀ i ∈ s, f i ≤ g i) (h' : ∃ i ∈ s, f i < g i) :
        (s.map f).sum < (s.map g).sum := by
      obtain ⟨l⟩ := s
      simp only [Multiset.quot_mk_to_coe'', Multiset.map_coe, Multiset.prod_coe]
      exact l.sum_lt_sum f g h h'
    ```
  - Bad argument names:
    ```lean

        {s : Multiset ι} {f g : ι → α}
        (hle : ∀ i ∈ s, f i ≤ g i) (hlt : ∃ i ∈ s, f i < g i) :
        (s.map f).sum < (s.map g).sum := by
      obtain ⟨l⟩ := s
      simp only [Multiset.quot_mk_to_coe'', Multiset.map_coe, Multiset.prod_coe]
      exact l.sum_lt_sum f g hle hlt
    ```
  - Acceptable argument names:
    ```lean
    lemma Multiset.sum_lt_sum {ι α : Type*} [OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid α]
        {s : Multiset ι} {f g : ι → α}
        (hfg : ∀ i ∈ s, f i ≤ g i) (hfg' : ∃ i ∈ s, f i < g i) :
        (s.map f).sum < (s.map g).sum := by
      obtain ⟨l⟩ := s
      simp only [Multiset.quot_mk_to_coe'', Multiset.map_coe, Multiset.prod_coe]
      exact l.sum_lt_sum f g hfg hfg'
    ```
  - Better argument names:
    ```lean
    lemma Multiset.sum_lt_sum {ι α : Type*} [OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid α]
        {s : Multiset ι} {f g : ι → α}
        (all_f_le_g : ∀ i ∈ s, f i ≤ g i) (exists_f_lt_g : ∃ i ∈ s, f i < g i) :
        (s.map f).sum < (s.map g).sum := by
      obtain ⟨l⟩ := s
      simp only [Multiset.quot_mk_to_coe'', Multiset.map_coe, Multiset.prod_coe]
      exact l.sum_lt_sum f g all_f_le_g exists_f_lt_g
    ```
  - Best argument names:
    ```lean
    lemma Multiset.sum_lt_sum {ι α : Type*} [OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid α]
        {s : Multiset ι} {f g : ι → α}
        (all_le : ∀ i ∈ s, f i ≤ g i) (exists_lt : ∃ i ∈ s, f i < g i) :

      exact l.sum_lt_sum f g all_le exists_lt
    ```

### Other

- We prefer not to write parentheses after quantifiers.
- We do not write a space after `¬` but we write redundant parentheses around the negated expression unless it is a single token.
- Orphaning parentheses is allowed.
- We like to use our custom notation declared at the beginning of the [Basic](https://github.com/Ivan-Sergeyev/seymour/blob/main/Seymour/Basic.lean) file.
- We do not write `.1` and `.2` to access fields; write their names instead (with the exception for `Iff.mp` and `Iff.mpr` where we prefer our notation `.→` and `.←` respectively).
- We prefer Mathlib's `have` over Lean's `have` inside tactic-block proofs.
- We usually annotate types even in situations where they can be inferred automatically.
